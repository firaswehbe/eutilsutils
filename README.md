# eutilsutils

utils for eutils that are based on [BioPython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page).

Some explanation of how to run BioPython and some of the code written in this
repo will be demonstrated in Jupyter Notebooks which can be [viewed
here](notebooks/).

The `scripts/` directory will have some general utility scripts for testing the
code or to demonstrate the functionality.
